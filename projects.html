                Winding Roads is a canvas generator. It uses a wave-function collapse algorithm to graph a set of 6 road pieces
                onto an nxm grid, such that every road vertex is connected to another road vertex and every grass vertex is connected 
                to another grass vertex. The end result is a complete image that looks aestetically pleasing (at least, I think so) 
                and logically fits together like a puzzle.

                ValoTracker is a Valorant player lookup tool. This uses HenrikDev's unofficial Valorant API. Check him out at 
                <a href="https://docs.henrikdev.xyz/">https://docs.henrikdev.xyz/</a>. He's an amazing developer. So far, my website works 
                on every server region and every player.

                    This is a Human-VS-AI Connect 4 game. It uses a minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning to search for the best move. 
                    I wrote the solver in C++ and compiled it to WebAssembly using Emscripten, which yielded a 10x speed increase. The bot searches a limit of 2 million moves, which takes
                    roughly 4 seconds on average. In the future, I hope to further optimize the solver by using a bitboard representation and adding a transposition table.

                I was insipred by Sebastian Lague's video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfMk-kjRv4c"target="_blank">How to Create a Neural Network (and Train it to Identify Doodles)</a>
                , where he gave a stellar explanation of the basics of machine learning and built a feed-forward Neural Network in C#. I built a feed-forward neural network in Python on top of Numpy arrays, wihtout
                using any other ML Libraries. The network has an adjustable depth, input size, hidden layer size, and output layer size. I trained it on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset and the Google QuickDraw! dataset.
                So far, it achives a validation accuracy of 95% and 82% on the two datasets, respectively. I created a simple pygame canvas to test it on my own digits and doodles, and it performs well, although I have no nominal data for that.

                    This is the culmination of a semester-long group project for my Freshman Engineering Honors course. My 3 teammates and I designed, modeled, documented, coded, tested, 
                    coded, tested... a robot. The robot's task was to serve as a waiter in a miniature model diner. It performed the following tasks: 
                    sliding an order ticket, flipping a burger, taking a tray to the trash can, operating a soft-serve machine, and changing the song on a jukebox. Our robot, affectionately named SCRAP-E, 
                    placed in the top 16 out of over 60 groups during the class competition. As the primary programmer, I learned an enormous amount about the 
                    collaborative testing and design progress that composes the daily responsibility of a software engineer.

    <p style="font-weight:bold;">Mobile Users: Tap the screen below if the model doesnt load. Use 1 finger to pan, 2
        fingers to drag, pinch to zoom</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;">Desktop Users: If the model runs slowly, go to chrome://settings, search "Use Hardware
        Acceleration" and turn it on. Left click to pan, Right click to drag, and use the scroll wheel to zoom. </p>
